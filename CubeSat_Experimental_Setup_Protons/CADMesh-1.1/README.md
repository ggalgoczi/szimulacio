# Introduction
Importing predefined CAD models into [GEANT4](http://www.geant4.org/geant4/) is not always possible or requires intermediate file format conversion to Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) using commercial or third party software.
CADMesh is a direct CAD model import interface for GEANT4 leveraging [ASSIMP](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/) for reading the CAD files.
Currently it supports the import of triangular facet surface meshes defined in formats such as STL and PLY. A G4TessellatedSolid is returned and can be included in a standard user detector constructor.
You can find the project page and a git repository [here](https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh).
The old [Google Code page for CADMesh](http://code.google.com/p/cadmesh/) is still kept up-to-date, however future developments occur here on GitHub.

Additional functionality is included for the fast navigation of tessellated solids by automatically creating equivalent tetrahedral meshes thereby making smart voxelisation available for the solid.

#Example Usage
The following shows basic default usage for cadmesh in a UserDetectorConstruction:

    // User Detector Constructor
    #include "CADMesh.hh"
    ...
    G4ThreeVector offset;
    G4VSolid * cad_solid;
    G4LogicalVolume * cad_logical;
    G4VPhysicalVolume * cad_physical;
    ...
    offset = G4ThreeVector(-30*cm, 0, 0);
    CADMesh * mesh = new CADMesh("../../models/cone.ply", mm, offset, false);

    cad_solid = mesh->TessellatedMesh();
    cad_logical = new G4LogicalVolume(cad_solid, water, "cad_logical", 0, 0, 0);
    cad_physical = new G4PVPlacement(0, G4ThreeVector(), cad_logical,
                                         "cad_physical", world_logical, false, 0);
    ...

    # CMakeLists.txt
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6 FATAL_ERROR)
    project(cadmesh_example)

    # GEANT4 core
    find_package(Geant4 REQUIRED ui_all vis_all)
    include(${Geant4_USE_FILE})
    include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

    # CADMesh
    find_package(cadmesh)

    file(GLOB headers ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/*.hh)

    add_executable(cadmesh_example cadmesh_example.cc ${sources} ${headers})
    target_link_libraries(cadmesh_example ${Geant4_LIBRARIES})
    target_link_libraries(cadmesh_example ${cadmesh_LIBRARIES})

# Dependencies
A working installation of the following libraries or packages is required:
 * [GEANT4](http:/geant4.org/geant4/)
 * [ASSIMP](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/)
 * [TETGEN](http://tetgen.org/)

They are included in the repository as external projects/submodules.

# Installation
Download the latest release of CADMesh from the [Downloads](https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh/releases) section, and extract the archive, or checkout the development branch from the repository.

    # CADMesh latest dev branch
    git clone https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh.git

    # OR download a release from https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh/releases, and extract the download somewhere.
    
    cd cadmesh/
    
    # Fetch the external dependancies (optional), running
    # cmake will result in this happening anyway.
    # git submodule update --init --recursive

    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<optional install location>
    sudo make install

Here is a basic example usage. The CMakeLists.txt file illustrates how to link against CADMesh (which requires CADMesh to be installed somewhere).

    # Run example (Linux with g++)
    cd examples/basic
    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake .. -Dcadmesh_DIR:PATH=<cadmesh install location> 
    make

    ./cadmesh_example <macro> <cad file name> <cad file type, optional>
    
    # Still in the build directory:
    ./cadmesh_example ../macros/vis.mac ../../../models/cone.ply
    Idle> exit

    # To use the tetrahedram meshing as well (tetgen needs to know the file type):
    ./cadmesh_example ../macros/vis.mac ../../../models/cone.ply PLY

If you get an error such as this:

    ./build/cadmesh_example: error while loading shared libraries: libcadmesh.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Make sure the CADMesh library is in your path:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<cadmesh install location>/lib

or on a Mac:
    
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:<cadmesh install location>/lib
