ALBEDO NEUTRONS

Here are spectra of albedo neutrons produced in interactions of cosmic 
rays with Earth's atmosphere. These fluxes for altitude 500 km are 
scaled fluxes for 100 km as described in ESA document ECSS-E-ST-10-04C, 
Sec. I-5. There are fluxes for two cases, both for solar minimum, when 
the cosmic ray flux reaching the atmosphere is higher:

Setting 1: is for high cut-off rigidity 16.6 GV. This high cut-off 
rigidity is basically near geomagnetic equator at south-east Asia at 100 km.

Setting 2: is for cut-off rigidity 5 GV, which is at 100 km at 
geographic latitudes around ~30-50 deg depending on longitude.

The albedo neutrons are coming to the satellite from the atmosphere, so 
from the solid angle of 3.931 sr for 500 km altitude.

COsmic primary electorns and positrons

Here are spectra of primary electrons and positrons in Cosmic Rays as 
modelled by Mizuno et al. 2004, ApJ, 614, 1113. Again as for the cosmic 
ray H and He I considered two settings:

setting 1 - solar minimum, geomagnetic latitude = 0 deg
setting 2 - solar minimum, geomagnetic latitude = orbit inclination (20 
deg) + tilt of geomagnetic dipole axis to geographical axis (9.6 deg) = 
29.6 deg

The flux depends a lot on geomagnetic latitude. Gábor could you please 
run your simulations for both settings for electrons as well as for 
positrons? So we have better knowledge about the background rate.

Same as for GCR the flux is not coming from 4 pi srad because of the 
occultation by the Earth, but at altitude 500 km it is coming from 8.635 
srad.

Btw, I am thinking that we might also need to run the simulations for 
spectra obtained for higher latitudes, just below the polar radiation 
belts. Next I will look at secondary pacticles due to GCR.

----------------------------------------

Secondary electrons and positrons

Here are spectra of secondary electrons and positrons which are created 
when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere. Similarly to the secondary protons, 
it is based on the AMS data at altitude 380 km (Mizuno et al. 2004). I 
am not sure if this flux can be used also for altitude 500 km. Campana 
et al. 2013 used this flux for their background estimations for LOFT at 
altitude 550-600 km. There are two cases:

setting 1 - near geomagnetic equator with geomagnetic latitude from 0.0 
to 0.3 rad.
setting 2 - geomagnetic latitude from 0.3 to 0.6 rad. This case covers 
inclination up to 25 deg (34.4 deg (0.6 sr) - 9.6 deg (tilt of 
geomagnetic dipole axis) = 25 deg).

Gábor could you please run your simulations for both settings for 
electrons as well as for positrons?

The upward and downward flux is the same, therefore we can consider that 
the flux is coming from 4 pi srad.

------------------------------------------------------

Secondary proton background

Here are spectra of secondary protons which are created when cosmic rays 
hit the atmosphere. It is based on the AMS data at altitude 380 km 
(Mizuno et al. 2004). I am not sure if this flux can be used also for 
altitude 500 km. Campana et al. 2013 used this flux for their background 
estimations for LOFT at altitude 550-600 km. The flux is basically for 
geomagnetic equator. It is for geomagnetic latitude < 0.2 rad. That 
means orbital inclination < 21 deg. The upward and downward flux is the 
same, therefore we can consider that the flux is coming from 4 pi srad.


-------------------------------------------------------

Cosmic ray spectra

Here are spectra of H and He in Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) obtained 
from SPENVIS. It is for the same 3 orbits, 500 km, inclination 20 deg, 
outside SAA, as I used in SPENVIS to obtain geomagnetically trapped 
electrons. The setting of the model and magnetosphere is the same as 
used by RADCUBE guys in their IAC paper. I obtained spectra for two 
cases quiet and stormy magnetosphere. There is not a big difference. The 
integral flux for low energies is about 5% higher for the stormy case 
compared to the quite case. I guess we can do Geant4 simulations with 
just the stormy magnetosphere flux. SPENVIS gives spectra also for 
heavier elements up to Ni, but they are at least 1 or 2 orders of 
magnitude lower than for He. For He the integral flux is about 10 times 
lower than for H, so I think it is enough to consider only H and He. We 
can simulate background count rate due to heavier elements in GCRs 
later, if we find that it is necessary, after we do it for H and He.

Note that the energies are in MeV per nucleon (MeV/n). The flux is not 
coming from 4 pi srad because of occultation by the Earth. So similarly 
to cosmic X-ray background the flux is coming to a satellite at altitude 
500 km from 8.635 srad.


More information on GCR. Attached are figures of the spectra of GCR H 
and He particles compared to model by Tsunefumi Mizuno et al. 2004, ApJ, 
614, 1113.  Mizuno et al. 2004 in their paper compare their model with 
the measurements from BESS, AMS-01 and Fermi LAT balloon experiment. If 
prof. Mizuno-san is in Hiroshima uni. when we are there we can discuss 
GCR with him. Fukazawa-san is also a co-author, so we can also discuss 
with him, too.

Figures show cases for two different parameter setting of the model 
Mizuno et al. 2004:
setting 1 - solar minimum, geomagnetic latitude = 0 deg
setting 2 - solar minimum, geomagnetic latitude = orbit inclination (20 
deg) + tilt of geomagnetic dipole axis to geographical axis (9.6 deg) = 
29.6 deg

For H and He particles I assumed 1H (only protons) and 4He, because they 
are dominant. According to Adriani et al. 2015 (arXiv1512.06535) the 
flux ratio 2H/1H is 0.02-0.03 and 3He/4He is 0.1-0.2.

I am now going to look at primary cosmic ray electrons and positrons.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Albedo gamma-rays

Here are spectra of albedo gamma-rays which are produced in interaction 
of cosmic rays (CRs) with Earth's atmosphere. The flux depends on the 
altitude and the geomagnetic inclination, because the flux of CRs 
hitting the atmosphere also depends on the geomagnetic latitude. The 
measurement is from Swift/BAT in range from ~20keV to ~200keV and 
described by Ajello et al. 2008, ApJ 689, 666, Fig. 16 and Sec. 6.1. 
Swift has orbit 550 km and inclination 20.6 deg, so it is a good 
reference for us for orbit outside the polar regions. The albedo 
gamma-rays come from the atmosphere, so from the solid angle of 3.93 sr 
for 500 km altitude. Gábor, could you please simulate the background 
count rate for CAMELOT also for this albedo gamma-ray flux?

trapped electron spectra outside SAA and polar regions and cosmic X-ray background

1)
Attached are figures with trapped electrons outside polar regions and 
SAA based on the same data which I sent you on Dec 26th. I just put 
fluxes for 5th, 95th percentiles and mean value together in one figure 
for better comparison.

2)
Attached are figures and data for Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). They 
are direct X-ray / Gamma-ray cosmic background and not including the 
Earth's atmospheric albedo X-rays. I will look at albedo X-rays 
tomorrow. The figures contain three empirical functions to describe CXB 
reported in papers:

Kasturirangan and Rao, ApSS 15, 161 (1972)
Gehrels, NIMPA, 313, 513  (1992)
Gruber et al., ApJ 520, 124 (1999)

The integral fluxes are calculated by integration of the differential 
fluxes from energy E up to 1 MeV for Kasturirangan and Rao 1972 and up 
to 10 MeV for Gehrels 1992 and Gruber et al. 1999. For Kasturirangan and 
Rao 1972 I integrated only up to 1 MeV because the fit they provide is 
based on measurements and in the range only up to 1 MeV. The most up to 
date publication is Gruber et al. 1999 and it is also referred by 
Richardo Campana so we can use that one as input to Geant4. A data file 
with the differential and integral spectrum for CXB spectrum described 
by Gruber et al. 1999 is attached for the range from 1keV to 10 MeV.

It is important to keep in mind that about 31% of the sky is occulted by 
the Earth at 500 km altitude. Exactly it is 8.635 sr is unocculted by 
the Earth. Therefore, when doing the simulations with Geant4 the 
detector can be, for simplicity, illuminated isotropically by the CXB 
spectrum scaled down by a factor of 8.635/4pi = 0.687 or it can be 
illuminated from a solid angle of 8.635 sr, but not from 4pi sr. This 
applies only for CXB and not for the geomagnetically trapped particles. 
Gábor, I did not check, how exactly you feed the spectra into Geant4. 
Maybe you multiply the differential spectra by 4pi sr and then input 
them into Geant4. If that is the case then for CXB the spectrum should 
be multiplied by 8.635 sr. Please keep it in mind and use these data 
CXB_Gruber_et_al_1999.dat for input to Geant4. Could you please do 
simulations with the CXB flux from this CXB_Gruber_et_al_1999.dat file? 
You already did it with spectrum described by one power-law 
(Kasturirangan and Rao 1972). However, spectrum by Gruber et al. 1999 is 
more up to date and it can be more accurate.

I am not sure which energy range we should use at the moment. Perhaps 
Gábor can do simulation in the range of CXB from 1 keV to 1 MeV. Above 
about 1-3 MeV the CXB flux is very low. We can try no shielding and then 
several mm of Al of CFRP. But that probbaly after we understand all the 
components of the background.

I am going to check other components such as albedo X-rays, CR, 
secondary particles due to CR, etc. and write you again.

Cheers,
Jakub

If you haven't run Geant4 simulation with CXB by Gruber et al. 1999, 
then please use fit by Ajello et al., ApJ, 689, 666 (2008), which I 
attach here. This fit is based on more and newer data including Swift/BAT.

Protons at polar regions

 checked if there are trapped protons in polar regions in the AP9 model 
at 500 km. The result is that there are some trapped protons in the 
south polar region, but the flux is very small compared to the trapped 
electrons. See the attached compressed files and figures about the part 
of one orbit at polar regions and the spectra of trapped electrons and 
protons generated by SPENVIS. No protons at north polar region for the 
part of the simulated orbit. The south polar region show relatively low 
energy protons (E<1-2MeV) with the average integral flux (number of 
particles with energy > E) obtained for 95th percentile that is 8 orders 
of magnitude lower than flux of trapped electrons.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


trapped electron spectra outside SAA and polar regions


I checked the AP9 and AE9 models of trapped protons and electrons, 
respectively. The models only describe trapped particles, and not 
primary cosmic rays, secondary particles etc., so I will send you the 
spectra of other components of background, which we need to consider in 
the simulations, in next emails. Trapped electrons largely contribute to 
the total background so they should be included in the simulations.

AP8 and AE8 models were static. Not varying with time and averaged over 
long periods of time. AP9 and AE9 gives levels of fluxes at any 
percentile from a distribution which contains statistical fluctuations 
and variation due to varying space weather. Therefore fluxes in any 
confidence interval can be obtained. That is advantage compared to AP8 
and AE8. Also AP9 and AE9 are newer models based on more up to date 
measurements and fluxes < 1 particle/(cm^2 s MeV) is provided.

In AP9 and AE9 models there are several parameters which can be set. Now 
I understand all of them:
Model version - version of the model as it has been developed, 1.5 is 
latest so I use that
Model run mode - montecarlo contains both the variation due to 
statistical fluctuations and space weather so I use that
Aggregate - allows to select any percentile from the distrubution of the 
simulated fluxes by Monte Carlo
Percentile [%] - select the percentile of the distribution of simulated 
fluxes
Energies - setting of energy bins, I use default SPENVIS energy binning 
(if need I can set finer energy binning)

Attached are trapped electron fluxes for altitude 500 km, inclination 20 
deg, spectra are averaged over three orbits outside SAA and polar 
regions, so they are in the regions with low background and the 
satellites will be observing GRBs. In the folder "orbits" there is 
description and figures showing the orbits. Then there are three folders 
with electron spectra for 5th percentile, mean value and 95th percentile.

I recommend to do three simulations with G4 using these three electron 
spectra, so we will have also the low boundary, mean value, and high 
boundary for the simulated detector count rate.

Proton spectra are zero for these orbits with low inclination as you can 
see in the files.

I suggest to do G4 simulations first without any shielding of the 
scintillator at the beginning. After we include all components of the 
background (X-ray, cosmic rays, trapped particles, etc.) then we can do 
G4 simulations for different thickness of Al or CFRP to optimize the 
shielding.

I will write you more in emails over next several days.
